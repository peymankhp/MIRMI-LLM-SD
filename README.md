## How to Install 🚀

### Installation via Python pip 🐍

MIRMI LLM can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you're using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install MIRMI LLM**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install MIRMI LLM:

   ```bash
   pip install mirmi-llm
   ```

2. **Running MIRMI LLM**:
   After installation, you can start MIRMI LLM by executing:

   ```bash
   mirmi-llm serve
   ```

This will start the MIRMI LLM server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [MIRMI LLM Documentation]( is ready to assist you.

> [!WARNING]
> When using Docker to install MIRMI LLM, make sure to include the `-v mirmi-llm:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

> [!TIP]  
> If you wish to utilize MIRMI LLM with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v mirmi-llm:/app/backend/data --name mirmi-llm --restart always ghcr.io/mirmi-llm/mirmi-llm:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server's URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v mirmi-llm:/app/backend/data --name mirmi-llm --restart always ghcr.io/mirmi-llm/mirmi-llm:main
  ```

- **To run MIRMI LLM with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v mirmi-llm:/app/backend/data --name mirmi-llm --restart always ghcr.io/mirmi-llm/mirmi-llm:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you're only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v mirmi-llm:/app/backend/data --name mirmi-llm --restart always ghcr.io/mirmi-llm/mirmi-llm:main
  ```

### Installing MIRMI LLM with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles MIRMI LLM with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v mirmi-llm:/app/backend/data --name mirmi-llm --restart always ghcr.io/mirmi-llm/mirmi-llm:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you're not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v mirmi-llm:/app/backend/data --name mirmi-llm --restart always ghcr.io/mirmi-llm/mirmi-llm:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both MIRMI LLM and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access MIRMI LLM at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄

### Other Installation Methods

We offer various installation alternatives, including non-Docker native installation methods, Docker Compose, Kustomize, and Helm. Visit our [MIRMI LLM Documentation]( or join our [Discord community]() for comprehensive guidance.

Look at the [Local Development Guide]( for instructions on setting up a local development environment.

### Troubleshooting

Encountering connection issues? Our [MIRMI LLM Documentation]( has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [MIRMI LLM Discord]().

#### MIRMI LLM: Server Connection Error

If you're experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v mirmi-llm:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name mirmi-llm --restart always ghcr.io/mirmi-llm/mirmi-llm:main
```

### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date

Check our Updating Guide available in our [MIRMI LLM Documentation](

### Using the Dev Branch 🌙

> [!WARNING]
> The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v mirmi-llm:/app/backend/data --name mirmi-llm --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/mirmi-llm/mirmi-llm:dev
```

### Offline Mode

If you are running MIRMI LLM in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.

```bash
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```
